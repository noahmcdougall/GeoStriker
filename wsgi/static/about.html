		      <h3>What is this?</h3>
					<hr />
					<p>It's essentially a more accurate way of doing three point problems to calculate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_and_dip">strike and dip</a>.  This method uses linear algebra to calculate the best fit plane to many XYZ points.  See this <a href="/static/assets/pdf/MathExplanation.pdf">write up</a> by Phillip McFarland for more details.</p>

					<h3>How is this useful?</h3>
					<hr />
					<p>Some possible uses are geologic mapping with satellite images, seismic fault interpretation, and water table determination.  Use your head and think of other applications.  I'm not your mom.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-1">
					<h3>Assumptions</h3>
					<hr />
					<p>This calculator assumes the surface can be approximated by a linear plane. If it cannot, break up the segments of the surface that you believe are linear planes and insert them separately.</p>
					<br />
					<p>This calculator only works with projected coordinates and where all three dimensions are in the same units.</p>

			<div class="col-1">
				<p>This program was created in response to:<br />1. Being annoyed that this didn't already exist<br />2. Wanting to learn to program.  This is my first program.  Cut me some slack.</p>
